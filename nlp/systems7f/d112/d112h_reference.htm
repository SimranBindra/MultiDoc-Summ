<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>In his report Sir Robert points to 'certain weaknesses' accepted by the MGN
board:
Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related
party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors
for approval;
Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the
movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were
also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies;
The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed
systems and mandates, but was not convened;
The finance department's inadequate authority to verify and record the
treasury department's activities.</a><br>
