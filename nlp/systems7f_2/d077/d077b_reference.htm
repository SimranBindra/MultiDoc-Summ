<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, 
mainly because I was awake this time</a><br>

<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>There were reports of injuries at Candlestick, where fans
were waiting for the World Series to begin, and the stadium was
evacuated, ABC-TV and Cable News Network reported</a><br>

<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>The report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the San 
Andreas near Parkfield in central California and Coachella in Southern 
California in the same period, but it pinpointed the Santa Cruz mountains as 
the most vulnerable spot in Northern California, in part because the area 
marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 
earthquake</a><br>

<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The damage in the Bay area occurred to the same kind of
structures heavily damaged in the 1987 Whittier quake in the Los
Angeles area, which registered a 5.9 Richter reading, Allen said</a><br>

<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>The nearest metropolitan area to Tuesday's earthquake, San Jose, has seen 
nearly a dozen earthquakes of 5 magnitude or greater in the last 10 years, but 
several of them have been on the Calaveras fault, which generally runs just 
east of San Jose, more than 10 miles east of San Andreas at this point</a><br>

<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>The high probability is based on several factors, including
length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in
1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at
the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.</a><br>
