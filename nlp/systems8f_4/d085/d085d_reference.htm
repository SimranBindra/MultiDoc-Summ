<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little

<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Officials said property damage 
from Hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on Charleston and 
then, instead of heading out to sea, veered northwest, hitting other population 
centers, including Charlotte, N.C. 




Losses Still Being Tallied 


Nationwide, based in Columbus, Ohio, is the biggest home and auto insurance in
